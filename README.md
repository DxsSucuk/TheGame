# TheGame

# Story Idea:

- Spawn in Darkroom (Basement? or Artic?)
- House in a random glitchy Terrain similiar Level with multiple houses that are broken down.
- AI having 3 States (Stalking, Attacking, Trapping)
- Stalking will keep the AI from attacking but keep the Player in view.
- Attacking will let the AI attack the Player by running onto him and trying to find him.
- Trapping will let the AI create Traps or find ways to jumpscare the Player (but not kill him)
- No save states.
- User will need to find Items to find notes or hints on the map (example: UV light on a specific Wall)
- As a middle part the game will become „alive“, it is going to access User files for Username and other stuff.
- After doing it, it will shutdown.
- On next boot up it will start as normal, but with a slight change in the AI and map.
- Is more glitchy and the AI becomes more aggresiv.
- After this the game well get more „alive“ and start changing user data. (Background and stuff)
- After this the game comes to its „end“, where the AI switches the Model to the Nef model.
- In this pre end game the game will get more glitch, to the point that the user falls.
- If the User falls for atleast 5 min he will get a Image shown with encrypted Text.
